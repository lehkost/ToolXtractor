“Quantifying Kissinger” is a digital analysis of the National Security
Archive’s Henry A. Kissinger Correspondence Collection comprising more
than 18,600 now-declassified meeting memoranda and teleconference transcripts
of the former US Secretary of State and National Security Advisor. This poster
will demonstrate the capability of multidimensional data visualizations to
enhance historical interpretation and understanding of complex big data
archives and data sets. Specifically, this poster’s virtual and
physical visualizations leverage the use of additional spatial and/or temporal
dimensions, including the use of animation and interactivity, to facilitate a
distant, but nuanced, reading of Kissinger and his correspondence.
