Introduction

This paper reports a co-words domain analysis of Buddhism literature collected
by DLMBS (Digital Library and Museum of Buddhist studies) at National Taiwan
University. Established in 1995, the DLMBS is one of the most comprehensive
online repository of Buddhist research materials. It currently contains over
400 thousand records of books, research papers, theses and dissertations in 45
languages and digitized Buddhist scriptures. A controlled vocabulary, which
is in five languages, including Chinese, English, Japanese, German, and French,
was used to help users search DLMBS’s bibliographic database. By using
cooccurrence data of author assigned keywords in the bibliographic records,
this study attempts to generate co-word networks in three different
languages, Chinese, English, and Japanese, to compare regional focuses on
Buddhist studies.

Co-words analysis has been shown to be effective in mapping the intellectual
structure of disciplines (He, 1999; Leydesdroff, 1989). While it has
been widely used in the domains of sciences and technologies (e.g. Buitelaar,
Bordea, & Coughlan, 2014; Ding, Chowdhury, & Foo, 2001; Bhattacharya &
 Basu,1998; Looze, & Lemarie, 1997; Peters & van Raan, 1993a, 1993b; Courtial,
1994; Tijssen, 1992; Callon, Courtial, & Laville, 1991; Rip & Courtial,
1984), to the best our knowledge, it has so far not been applied to humanities.
Part of the advantage of using co-word in sciences and technologies is the
highly codified subject languages, therefore a higher degree of consistency
between concepts and terms in these fields. We believe that a cross-language
co-word analysis of Buddhist studies literature would be a worthwhile endeavor
for a couple of reasons: Firstly, it has been pointed out that there has been a
wide variety of methods, perspectives and subject matters within the
international communities of Buddhist studies. The heterogeneity of its
scholarships can be partly traced to their geographic roots (Cabezón, 1995). It
is therefore interesting to empirically study whether and how the intellectual
structures reflected in the published literatures in these language communities
differ from one another. A comparison of the intellectual structures can shed
light on knowledge interests shared and distinct in these three
language communities. From the methodological plain, co-word analysis also
provides a viable alternative to citation-based network analysis in humanities
where the citation structure is known to be much sparser than in sciences and
technologies.

Procedures and analysis

Three separate co-word networks were generated in three different languages
where nodes denote the keywords and edges the strength of their cooccurrence.
Unlike in most of the previous co-words analysis, where keywords were extracted
from titles and abstracts, author assigned keywords were used here as it is
believed that they are more representative to the content of the articles and
tend to have higher degree of consistency than keywords in free-text.
For monographs and other types of publications, the subject-headings assigned
by human indexers were used as keywords. Edge weights were normalized by both
the inclusion and the Jaccard index (Courtial,1986; Callon, Law, & Rip,1986).

Thus three word similarity matrixes were generated so social network analytical
methods such as cohesion, centrality and community-detection (Blondel et.al.,
2008) could be performed with a view to exploring the social and cognitive
structure of Buddhist studies manifested in its published literature in
respective languages. Specifically, the study seeks to answer the following
interrelated research questions: firstly, are there recognizable branches or
specialties in Buddhist studies? If so, what might these areas of research be?
Cross-languages comparisons were also made to examine the similarities and
differences of the intellectual structure in different language communities.

Table 1. Types of publications analyzed

Due to the enormous size of the networks, some sorts of filtering are required
to make the groupings intelligible; node degrees was used as the filter as many
of the little connected nodes tend to generate noises that impairs meaningful
interpretation. To determine the proper threshold of node degree, one needs to
consider three criteria: the quality of the clustering, the interpretability of
the individual clusters, and the preservation of information. A high threshold
would filter out large amount of nodes hence the greater loss of information
and low modularity values. On the other hand, a low threshold would result in
difficulty in interpreting individual clusters as they tend to lump together
heterogeneous topics. Thus a trade-off needs to be made. We approached this
matter by performing modularity analysis at different threshold levels so the
values of their modularity, the resulting number of communities, as well as the
size of the networks could be recorded. The following heuristics were used
to select the proper thresholds: to preserve about 10

percent of the total nodes, to limit the number of communities from 10 to 20,
and to preserve a high degree of modularity, which is commonly used as the

After filtering out lesser connected nodes, modularity maximizing community
detection method was then performed to identify the subdomains in each language
network. A two-stage approach was adopted here. As some of the communities
resulting from the first-round of clustering can still be very broad and
heterogeneous, a second modularity analysis was performed on these relative
“super” clusters (i.e. clusters with more than 400 nodes), the joint results
produce a two-levels hierarchical structure. Three experts in Buddhist studies
were then interviewed to help us interpret the clusters (See Figure 4 and 5).

In this study we utilized co-words networks to visually represent the domain of
Buddhist studies. A heuristic was proposed to help select the proper threshold
in order to filter less significant keywords. A two-stage clustering approach
was adopted, which arguably provides a finer representation of the intellectual
structure of the domain. Further analysis will be done, with the help of domain
experts, to compare the differences in the intellectual structure reflects in
three language communities.
