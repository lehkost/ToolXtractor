Using stereoscope cards and a stereoscope viewer from 1900, held in the Thomas
Fisher Rare Book Library and the University of Toronto Mississauga Library,
this poster presents the history of early immersive viewing experiences by
tracing the history of 3D ways of seeing from the stereoscope cards to
Oculus Rift and Google cardboard. Secondly, we offer tools for teaching with
archival photographic materials, examining the histories of seeing, and
integrating digital tools in the curriculum to enrich students' access to these
cards' histories while also introducing recent VR development tools such as
Unity, and Cardboard. Lastly, by using 3D scanning and printing we
replicate the viewer, further expanding possible student engagement with DH
tools, methods, and theories. The resulting student projects can be archived in
a virtual exhibit (using Omeka), and the meta-data and data from the cards and
viewer added to the objects' records.

The goal of this pilot project is to develop an ‘out of the box' teaching
resource for use in the classroom that offers analogue and digital engagement
with rare materials, questions the histories of seeing stereoscopically, and
contextualizes contemporary devises for seeing this way in a longer history of
photography and immersive media that is often overlooked. Our project pushes
students and researchers to consider the longer genealogy of virtual reality
viewers and draws on previous work such as that of the Stereogranimator at the
New York Public Library lab. In so doing, we seek to recover early histories of
immersive media, photography, printing, and popular entertainment in the early
20^th century.
