Most commentators locate the origin of digital humanities (DH) in humanities
computing of the mid-20 th century. Dalbello (2011), for example, begins
her account in 1946 with Roberto Busa’s plans for the Index Thomisticus, a
massive attempt to encode nearly 11 million words of Thomas Aquinas on IBM
punch cards. This event (and the narrative that follows) is found throughout
the literature, leading some to believe that early DH work “concentrated,
perhaps somewhat narrowly, on text analysis (such as classification systems,
mark-up, text encoding, and scholarly editing)” (Presner 2010, 6). Others
seem convinced that DH is still only text analysis—and misguided in its
approach (Fish 2012).

This paper presents an empirical perspective on the early history of digital
humanities by tracing publications in two foundational journals (Computers and
the Humanities, established in 1966, and Literary and Linguistic Computing,
established in 1986), with particular emphasis on media types and
authors’ disciplines.

Background

Despite the variety and breadth of definitions of DH (e.g., Gold 2012 and
Terras 2012), narratives of its history have been surprisingly homogenous.
Hockey (2004) and later authors (Svensson 2009, 2010, 2012; Kirschenbaum 2010;
Dalbello 2011) all ground DH in mid-20th century humanities computing, a view
that is all but orthodox in short and anecdotal histories of the field.
According to this narrative, DH begins in 1946 with the Index Thomisticus and
proceeds through advances in corpus linguistics to the founding of the journal 
Computers and the Humanities (CHum) in 1966. These early projects are hindered
by storage capacity, hardware costs, and processing limits; progress is slow.
Though Svensson (2009) admits that not every article during this time is about
text analysis, he notes that the field had narrowed enough by 1986 for Literary
and Linguistic Computing (LLC) to supplant CHum as the premier humanities
computing journal (note the journal titles). Hockey similarly describes
the 1970s and 1980s as a period of “consolidation” of text analysis methods. As
storage and processing capabilities increased from the late 1970s
onward, structured electronic text and multimedia archives dominated the field,
followed in the 1990s by Internet-enabled hypertexts, digital libraries, and
collaborative editing. The overarching theme of this narrative is text, with
the plot revolving around corpora of increasing size and susceptibility to
machine analysis.

Though this account dominates historical views of the field, it raises four
separate concerns. First, it privileges certain disciplines, projects, and
tools at the expense of others (e.g., quantitative history, which is absent
from the narrative). Second, it fails to chart an actual historical path from
early work in text analysis to “big tent” DH (Jockers & Worthey 2011;
 Pannapacker 2011a, b), encompassing everything from digital archives and
databases to GIS, network analysis, new publishing formats, digital
pedagogy, and so on. Third, it precludes historicizing and contextualizing
current work that falls outside of text analysis, which may lead to a lack of
attention to method, its historical complexities, and points of convergence
with related fields such as the social sciences. Finally, these histories all
suffer from a lack of evidence; the narrative is assumed and applied rather
than documented.

An alternative approach would attend to the various methods, platforms, and
tools that animate current DH work and investigate their origins in
the literature. Ball (2013), for instance, has drawn attention to longstanding
interest in computers and technology within writing studies. Scheinfeldt (2014)
 has pointed to the historical importance of oral history in the history of DH.
Significantly, Nyhan, Flinn, and Welsh’s (2013) project, “Hidden Histories,”
collects and archives oral histories from those who worked in the field during
its first decades. These efforts are in broad solidarity with the empirical
history presented here and contribute to the growing number of heterodox
histories of DH.

Methodology

The corpus for this study consisted of 1,334 research articles published in 
Computing and the

Humanities (1966-2004) and Literary & Linguistic Computing (1986-2004). This
end date reflects the final issue of CHum and predates wide circulation of 
A Companion to Digital Humanities (2003), which was important in shaping DH in
many ways. We omitted introductions, reviews, conference reports, and
other articles that did not primarily present original research.

We manually inspected each article for media type and applied one of six
categories (e.g., text, image, sound, object, number, other). For articles
that addressed more than one media type, we recorded 'multimedia'. After
inspecting several hundred articles, we added 'technology' as a media type
to accommodate articles primarily about technology (e.g., AI, databases,
hardware), rather than its application to a particular media. Using all eight
codes (see Table 1), we coded or re-coded all the articles.

Table 1. Media types coded in this study

In addition to media type, we recorded information about each author's
discipline(s) and country of institutional affiliation. In the case of faculty
appointed to more than one department, we recorded the discipline as
'multiple,' reasoning that an interdisciplinary appointment is more than a
simple conjunction of its constituent departments. For authors located outside
of traditional academic departments, we used one of three codings,
where appropriate: 'center', 'non-academic', or 'GLAM' (galleries, libraries,
archives, and museums). The remaining cases were clustered into one of 21
broad disciplines spanning the humanities and other areas.

Finally, we recorded whether each article had a focus on teaching and learning
(e.g., courseware, language learning software).

Data on media type, disciplines, and teaching and learning were visualized
using the free software

Tableau Public and are available at http://bit.ly/earlydh.

Findings

The number of articles published each year varies from 6-50 (see Fig 1), the
latter owing mainly to a double issue of CHum published in 1994/1995, which we
recorded as 1995 because of its copyright date. Given the varying number of
articles per year, we report several figures below as relative percentages each
year (relative to the total number of articles that year). In cases where the
two journals are compared, we also report relative percentages (relative to
all articles from that journal in the corpus) because there are nearly twice as
many total articles from CHum as compared to LLC, given their years of
coverage.

Media type

Text is the most frequently studied medium (59% CHum, 72% LLC), but sound,
multimedia, and reflections on technology are all present in the
early literature (see Figs 2-3). These distributions vary by journal, with text
being much more prominent in LLC. 'Other' is, admittedly, a rather large
category at around 4% overall, but the heterogenous articles found there are
not easily resolved into one or more media types, which is the focus of these
codings, or even a primary theme, such as 'technology.' To some extent, many
of these articles speak to the emergence of a field with its own meta-level
discussions about theory and the production of knowledge. These articles are
found throughout the early literature of DH and increase slightly around the
end of the corpus, when “digital humanities” as such might be said to emerge.

Disciplinarity

The distribution of authors' disciplines present in each journal is shown in
Fig. 4. Computing and computer science is most frequent, largely because of the
amount of coauthors from those areas. English language and literature is the
most frequent humanities disciplines, commensurate with Kirschenbaum's claim
that DH's “professional apparatus...is probably more rooted in English than any
other departmental home” (2010, 55). However, authors from languages and
literatures departments other than English are nearly as common, as
are centers, labs, and non-academic affiliations.

[347-4]

Figure 4. Articles by discipline

Some disciplines work with certain media types more than others (see Fig 5).
For example, scholars of languages and literatures work almost exclusively with
text, while art historians appear to favor multimedia.

Figure 5. Media type by discipline Location

Together, CHum and LLC represent nearly 50 different countries based on
authors' institutional affiliations (see Fig 6).

[347-5]

Figure 6. Location of authors

A small but appreciable portion of articles (5.6%, 75 articles) are
international (i.e., with co-authors from institutions in different countries).
However, the vast majority of authors in CHum and LLC hail from American and
British institutions (respectively), though this predominance declines over the
course of both journals (see Fig. 7). This data, as well as the largely
Anglophone nature of these journals, presents a limited picture of early DH. A
fuller analysis would include work published in other places and languages.

[347-6]

Figure 7. Location of authors over time Teaching & Learning

There has been longstanding interest in teaching and learning in the field (as
shown in Fig. 8), though less so within LLC. Peaks in each graph reflect
special issues on teaching and learning published by each journal.

Discussion and Future Directions

Rather than focusing on select disciplines, projects, tools, etc., this study
includes the full range of early DH work (to the extent it appears in our
corpus). The breadth of this picture helps set up the “big tent” view found in
current accounts of the field. It also gives ground for historicizing and
contextualizing the myriad forms of DH work today. One can imagine exploring
this data to discover early DH articles about sound, in classics, from France,
etc. and then consulting those primary source articles. Our study does provide
some evidence for the claim that early DH work involves text experiments.
Significantly, however, it documents the actual extent of that work (59%

CHum, 72% LLC), and in so doing, highlights other work in the early history of
the field.

Our next steps include exploring additional sources to expand our corpus. In
part, this includes investigating disciplinary journals for early DH articles.
We might also identify such articles or journals by mining citations in our 
CHum/LLC corpus or by consulting sources such as the Companion. There are
existing lists of early DH books as a starting point for monographs.

In addition, the full text of our corpus presents several possibilities for
analysis, including a citation study that might address questions of
transference between disciplines and the degree to which corpus articles cite
each other (forming their own scholarly discourse) as compared to literature
outside of core DH journals.
