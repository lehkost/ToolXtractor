Introduction

Existing studies of anglophone digital humanities (DH) curricula have examined
course syllabi (Terras 2006; Spiro 2011) and the development of programs at
specific institutions (Rockwell 1999; Siemens 2001; Sinclair 2001; Unsworth
2001; Unsworth and Butler 2001; Drucker, Unsworth, and Laue 2002; Sinclair &
 Gouglas 2002; McCarty 2012; Smith 2014). This study adds to the literature on
teaching and learning by presenting a survey of formal degree and
certificate programs in anglophone DH.

While these programs represent only part of the entire DH curricula, they are
important in several respects: First, they reflect intentional groupings
of courses, concepts, skills, methods, and techniques, purporting to represent
the field in its broadest strokes. Second, these programs include
explicit learning outcomes, and their requirements form one picture of what all
DHers are expected to know upon graduation. Third, formal programs organize
teaching, research, and professional development in the field; they are
channels through which material and symbolic capital flow and thereby shape the
field itself. Finally, these programs, their requirements, and coursework are
one way—perhaps the primary way— in which prospective students encounter the
field and make choices about whether to enroll in a DH program and, if so,
which one.

In addition to helping define the field, a study of DH programs also has the
capacity to comment on pedagogical discussions in the literature. Hockey,
for example, has long wondered whether programming should be taught in the
field (1986) and asks, “How far can the need for analytical and critical
thinking in the humanities be reconciled with the practical orientation of much
work in humanities computing?” (2001). Also skeptical of mere technological
skills, Mahony and Pierazzo (2002) argue for teaching methodologies or “ways of
thinking” in DH, and Clement examines multiliteracies in DH (e.g.,
critical thinking, commitment, community, and play), which help to push the
field beyond “training” to a more humanistic pursuit (2012, 372). Others have
called on DH to engage more fully in critical reflection, especially in
relation to technology and the role of the humanities in higher education
(Brier 2012, Liu 2012, Walzer 2012).

These and other concerns point to longstanding questions about the proper
balance of skills and reflection in DH. While a study of DH programs
cannot address the value of critical reflection, it can report on its presence
(or absence). These findings, together with our more general observations about
DH activities, give pause to consider what is represented in, emphasized by,
and omitted from the field at its most explicit levels of educational
training. Methodology

We compiled a list of 37 DH programs active in 2015, drawn from public listings
(UCLA Center for Digital Humanities 2015; Clement 2015), background literature,
and web searches (e.g., “digital humanities masters”). In addition to degrees
and certificates, we included minors and concentrations in which humanities
content was the central focus, and omitted digital arts and media programs in
which this was not the case. Because our sources and searches are
all English-language, it limits what we can say about global DH.

We recorded the URL and basic information (e.g., title, level, location) about
each program and looked up descriptions of any required courses in
the institution’s course catalog. To analyze topics addressed in these
programs, we applied the Taxonomy of Digital Research Activities in
the Humanities (TaDiRAH 2014), which attempts to capture the “scholarly
primitives” of the field (Perkins et al. 2014). TaDiRAH contains forty
activities terms organized into eight parent terms (‘Capture’, ‘Creation’,
‘Enrichment’, ‘Analysis’, ‘Interpretation’, ‘Storage’,    ‘Dissemination’, and
‘Meta-Activities’).

TaDiRAH was chosen for its basis in the literature on “scholarly primitives”
(Unsworth 2000), as well as three earlier sources (an
arts-humanities.net taxonomy, DIRT categories and tags, and a
Zotero bibliography) and community feedback and revision.

We applied terms to program/course descriptions independently and then tested
intercoder agreement, which was extremely low. We attribute this to the many
terms in TaDiRAH, complexity of program/course description language, questions
of scope (i.e., using a broader or narrower term), and general vagueness. We
did find discussing our codings helpful and, in doing so, were able to
agree. Accordingly, each of us read and coded every program/course description
and discussed them until we reached consensus. Often, this involved pointing
to specific language in the descriptions and referencing TaDiRAH definitions or
notes from previous meetings when interpretations were discussed.

Findings and discussion

The number of DH programs has risen sharply over time, beginning in 1991 and
growing steadily by several programs each year since 2008 (see Figure 1).

Geography

Most of the programs studied here were located in the US (22 programs, 60%),
followed by Canada (6 programs, 16%), the UK (5 programs, 14%), Ireland
(3 programs, 8%), and Australia (1 program, 3%). We note that these programs
are all located in Anglophone countries and that TaDiRAH, too, originates from
this context, which necessarily limits what we can say about DH programs from a
global perspective.

Structure

Less than half of these DH programs grant degrees: some at the level of
bachelor’s (8%), most at the level of master’s (22%), and some at the doctoral
level (8%) (Figure 2). The majority of these programs are certificates, minors,
or specializations—certificates being more common at the graduate level and
nearly one-third of all programs studied here.

We also examined special requirements of these programs, finding that half
require some form of independent research (see Figure 3), and half require a
final deliverable, referred to variously as a capstone, dissertation,
portfolio, or thesis (see Figure 4). About one-quarter of these programs
require fieldwork, often an internship (see Figure 5).

Location & disciplinarity

Most of these programs are housed in colleges/schools of arts and humanities,
but about one-third    are outside of traditional

schools/departments, in centers, initiatives, and, in one case, jointly with
the library (see Figure 6). Most DH concentrations and specializations are
located within English departments, commensurate with Kirschenbaum’s claim that
DH’s “professional apparatus...is probably more rooted in English than any
other departmental home” (2010, 55).

Elective courses for these programs span myriad departments and disciplines,
from humanities departments (art history, classics, history,
philosophy, religion, and various languages) to along with computer science,
education, information and library science, design, media, and technology.

DH activities

We analyzed our TaDiRAH codings in two ways: overall term frequency (see Figure
7) and weighted frequency across programs (see Figure 8). To compute weighted
frequencies, each of the eight parent terms were given a weight of 1, which was
divided equally among the subterms in each area. These subterm weights were
summed to show how much of an area is represented, regardless of its size.

Analysis and meta-activities (e.g., ‘Community building’, ‘Project management’,
‘Teaching/Learning’) make up the largest share of activities, along
with creation (e.g., ‘Designing’, ‘Programming’, ‘Writing’). It is worth noting
that ‘Writing’ is one of the most frequent terms (11 programs), but this
activity certainly occurs elsewhere and is probably undercounted because it was
not explicitly mentioned in program descriptions. The same may be true
for other activities.

Figure 8. Digital humanities programs in this study and their required courses
(by area)

Enrichment and storage terms (e.g., ‘Archiving’, ‘Organizing’, ‘Preservation’)
were generally sparse (only 1.9% of all codings), but we suspect
these activities do occur in DH programs and courses—in fact, they are assumed
in broader activities such as thematic research collections, content
management systems, and even dissemination. Generally, there seems to be less
emphasis on content (‘Capture’, ‘Enrichment’, and ‘Storage’ terms) and more
focus on platforms and tools (‘Analysis’ and ‘Meta-Activities’ terms) in the
programs studied here—or at least, those may be more marketable to
prospective students and institutions, two important audiences of program
webpages.

Theory and critical reflection

To analyze theory and critical reflection, we focused our analysis on two
terms: ‘Theorizing’ and ‘Meta: GiveOverview’, which we used to code theoretical
or historical introductions to DH itself. We found that all programs studied
here included some mention of theory or historical/systematic overview (see
Figure 9). Our codings, of course, do not reveal anything further about the
character of this reflection, whether it is the type of critical reflection
called for in the literature, or how it interfaces with skills and techniques
in these programs.

We plan to publish our data and visualizations publicly for researchers,
students, and those developing curriculum: http://bit.ly/DHprograms. We believe
it provides a baseline of field growth, areas, structure, and learning
experiences, which can be used to measure changes in future, in addition to
providing a data-driven perspective on the field today.

In that respect, we hope this study gives the community pause to consider how
DH is described, represented, and taught. If there are common expectations not
reflected here, perhaps we could be more explicit about those, at least in
building our taxonomies and describing our formal programs and required
courses. Conversely, if there are activities that seem overrepresented here, we
might consider
