Introduction

From the Lexicon to the eLexicon

The first fascicle of the Lexicon mediae et infimae Latinitatis Polonorum
(Dictionary of Polish Medieval Latin, henceforth LMILP) was published in 1953.
The project aims at providing an exhaustive account of the Latin vocabulary
used on Polish territory during the Middle Ages. Addressed to a scholarly
public, the dictionary does not make many concessions to a less advanced user.
Information is often conveyed only indirectly, by means of typographic devices
or is left to be inferred by the reader. The project of retro-digitization of
the LMILP started in the mid-2011 and was

completed by the mid-2014. The web application, although completed, is still
subject to modifications and

refinements.

Dictionary Annotation

The XML encoding of the dictionary was by no means an ultimate goal of the
project. Instead, the idea was to make the rich content of the LMILP fully
searchable through a user-friendly interface. This objective, however, has
deeply influenced the XML schema design. The TEI (TEI Consortium 2016) was
chosen as an annotation standard because at the time the work started it had
been already employed in major electronic lexicography projects (Lewis-Short by
the Perseus Project; DuCange by the ENC). The popularity that the standard had
gained among scholars contributed to emergence of lively community which
produced documentation and use cases which supplemented the “Dictionaries”
chapter of the TEI Guidelines. Also, the very fact that the TEI Guidelines
offered a set of ready-to-use tags for the description of lexicographic content
was not without significance. Finally, the TEI XML was supported by major
software providers, an important factor for the project in which adaptation of
existing rather than writing new software was planned.

Workflow

The paper dictionary was scanned and the output of the OCR program (Abbyy
FineReader 11) was exported to ODT files; from each a content.xml file
was extracted and then applied a series of XSL transformations. The main goal
was to simplify styles that were automatically generated by the OCR
software. Resulting XML files underwent second phase of XSL processing in which
constitutive parts of the dictionary, such as entry, headword, sense definition
etc., were encoded. The output XML files were again retranslated into ODT
format: entries were encoded as paragraph styles, other tags were represented
as character styles. In the next phase of the project the lexicographers
started to proofread OCR text and correct errors of automatic annotation. This
task was performed with the help of LibreOffice Writer exclusively without
annotators being actually conscious of the underlying XML structure. From the
practical point of view, annotation consisted in verifying whether automatic
XSL processing produced correct styles; if this was not the case correct style
had to be applied, as in standard text processing task.

This approach allowed for reducing the learning curve to a minimum so that the
team members could focus on the lexicographic content. However, it also has a
serious drawback: annotation in the text editor cannot produce more complex
hierarchies, since paragraph and character styles allow for representing
at best two levels deep nesting.

TEI for the eLexicon

A guiding principle of the subsequent TEI annotation was to combine editorial
and lexical view of the dictionary content by (1) preserving its original
text and (2) storing normalized data in attributes and empty XML elements.
Typographic properties of the

text, on the other hand, were not generally encoded, they are easily
reconstructible though.

Automatic and manual annotation consisted in three major procedures:

a. translation: custom ODT styles (corresponding to elements of dictionary
structure) were “translated” into respective TEI elements or attributes;

b. grouping: deeply nested XML structure was produced from flat annotation;

c. enrichment: implicit information was made explicit.

Translation

The paper justifies some of the annotation choices. Special attention is given
to the peculiarities of encoding a scholarly lexicographic work.

1. <entryFree> element was chosen as a container for dictionary entries.

2. Essential features of the dictionary macro-and microstructure are encoded
as:

<form>, <orth>;    <gramGrp>, <gen>,

<iType>, <pos>; <etym>, <lang>, <mentioned>;    <cit>,    <bibl>, <biblScope>,

<date>, <quote>; <sense>, <usg>, <def>, <gloss>; <xr>, <ref>; <lbl>; <re>,
<certainty>, <oVar>, <note>.

3. Content and form peculiarities of the LMILP are reflected in respective
attributes. So, for example, functional variation of the entries is represented
in the @type attribute of the <entryFree> and can take one of the following
values: main, xref, hom.

4. The TEI schema was only lightly customized: unused elements were deleted; a
few content restrictions were overcome.

Grouping: adding depth

The flat entry structure had to undergo heavy XSL

processing, so deep nesting typical of scholarly dictionaries could eventually
emerge. Relative ease of the XML-unaware manual annotation resulted in
timeconsuming post-processing. The xsl:for-each-group

XSL function was employed in order to structure:

1. citation groups:

<cit>

<bibl>

<ref type="siglum" target="fons:RachJag">RachJag </ref> cbiblScope type="pp" n=
^ll215">p. 215 </biblScope>

3. PoS and grammar groups:

Enrichment: expanding the dictionary content

Considerable effort was put into enriching the original content of the
dictionary, namely: (1) resolving references, (2) normalizing strings, (3)
adding redundant and/or inferred information.

Resolving references

A typical reference to an exact location in the dictionary text was encoded as
follows:

[055-3]


References to a specific entry or sense relied on the @xml:id attribute:

<xr>

<label>Cf.</label>

cref target="#caballinus.2">CABALLINUS 2</ref> </xr>

The encoding of most frequent type of references (pointing to a source of a
language use example) is illustrated in the section II B 4 above.

String normalization

By string normalization, we mean a set of various procedures applied in order
to generate a lexical view of the dictionary content. Standardized strings
are usually stored in @norm attributes of such elements as language or usage
labels, prepositional and inflec-

tional patterns etc. Their primary goal is to enable unified search that would
be agnostic of the exact formulation of the paper dictionary. For example, when
looking up philosophy-related terms one should be able to retrieve them no
matter whether they have been marked with a phil. label or with more verbose
formula in textibus philosophicis “in philosophical texts”, as both are
annotated as @norm= ”phil”. The second major goal of the normalization was to
render chronological information consistent and machine-readable. Its proper
annotation should reflect the fact that many medieval texts cannot be dated but
only approximately. Apart from some obvious cases (@when attribute stores a
year date, for example <time when="1450">a. 1450</time>) the LMILP employs:

1. century dates

(<time    notBefore="1401" no-

tAfter="1500">saec. XV</time> )

2. imprecise dates in year (<time no-tAfter="1120">ante 1120</time>) or century
format (<time notBefore="1401" no-tAfter="1450">saec. XV in.</time>).

Making information explicit

Finally, substantial effort has been devoted to making explicit what is not
expressed directly in the paper dictionary, but left to be inferred by an
expert user. In the LMILP, this is the case, for example, of a part of speech
label which is provided for adverbs or conjunctions, but is normally omitted
from verb or noun entries. Empty elements have therefore been created and their
attributes filled with the inferred content. So, in a typical case, an element 
<pos norm="subst"/> would be appended to a <gramGrp> group whenever the paper
dictionary informs about a word's part-of-speech only indirectly, by means of a
gender label (f. for Lat. femininum) or inflectional ending typical of nouns (
-ae):

The Dictionary Web Application

The last part of the paper briefly presents the overall architecture of the
dictionary web application, its user interface having been already described
elsewhere (Nowak 2014). Written entirely in XQuery, the application is served
directly from the eXist-db instance with HTML and JavaScript code being
equally stored in a database or generated on the fly. The presentation focuses
on those features available in the eXist-db which are of critical importance
for dictionary application design:

1.    Various types of indexes available in the eX-ist-db allow for efficient
retrieval of content from deeply nested dictionary files and dispersed textual
data.

2.    A templating system allows for fine-grained web presentation of the XML
content.

3.    A URL rewriting engine supports a logical system of dictionary content
access.

4.    An out-of-the-box RESTful API exposes lexicographic content to external
applications.

In the conclusion, I will also point to some difficulties that I have
encountered and which have mainly to do with handling application's state, a
crucial feature for multi-language tools which require storing user search
results.
