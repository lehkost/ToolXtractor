With the explosion of academic interest in 3D modeling and interactive
environments, two questions dominate: How can scholars and educators
access these models? And how can they be integrated into the

classroom? Enter VSim - a much-needed software interface for academics
exploring applications for 3D

computer models in humanities research and teaching - and the VSim Repository
and Archive, both now available through the UCLA Library.

VSim is an easy-to-use software interface that allows real-time exploration of
highly detailed, academically generated 3D computer models in both formal and
informal educational settings across grade levels and humanities disciplines.
The VSim Repository and Archive provides a platform for the dissemination
of academically generated 3D content.

This poster presentation is both a launch announcement and a solicitation for
submissions from content creators. If you are working in 3D, please consider
sharing your projects for teaching and learning through the VSim Repository and
Archive.
