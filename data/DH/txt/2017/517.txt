This study first aims to recognize the significance of the Korean diaspora in
narrating the history of modern Korea. About 7 million Koreans are estimated
to live in 160 different countries around the world. This population of
overseas Korean residents is equal to roughly 10% of the total combined
populations of South and North Korea. The Korean diaspora was an unintended
consequence of the unfortunate events of modern Korean history, including
famine, colonial oppression, and war. Despite the Korean diaspora's relatively
short history from around the mid-19th century, it is characterized by myriad
challenges and responses in various settings. Indeed, each wave of Korean
immigration was driven by different historical factors in Korea as well as the
host countries, and thus the motivations and characteristics of Korean
immigrants in each period were also substantially different.

Secondly, this study intends to design a community-based archive of the Korean
diaspora. The Korean diaspora consists of various classes and generations
so that their history is hardly written from a single perspective with limited
resources. Thus, this study investigates the importance of community archives,
and in particular the role of these archives in the production of collective
identities via academic and popular public histories, exhibitions and other
interactions. By utilizing a variety of digital media technology as well
as knowledge mapping tools, this study aims to root and reconnect the Korean
diaspora in flux so that it would suggest a way of re-balancing
misrepresentation and absence in the modern Korean history. To build
community-based archives as community-owned spaces is eventually not about a
return to the past but about an access to the future.
