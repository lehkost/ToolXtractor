Introduction

The Kanseki Repository is a large repository of premodern Chinese texts.
Currently it holds more than 9000 texts, covering all periods of Chinese
history from early antiquity to the beginning of the 20th century. The
repository is organized into 6 top-level categories and offers full-text search
across all textual variants.

Since its opening to the public in March 2016, a frequent request from users
was to be able to find texts related to a certain text, especially to
investigate and evaluate textual dependencies. This poster reports on some
experiments to find an effective way to respond to this requests.

What is needed to solve this problem is an efficient way to identify text
passages that are derived from other, earlier texts (based on the assumption
that the texts in question can in fact be reliably dated). Such passages will
be called citations here, although the usage here is not limited to true
citations, but also includes quotations from memory, paraphrases and allusions
- cases where the reference does not follow the exact wording of the source. As
an additional complication, we need to take into account the possibility that
the received text differs from the text available to the author of the text
that contains the reference.

Related work has examined plagiarism detection (Gipp and Meuschke, 2011 and
Schultz, 1999), but the approach taken here makes direct use of some of the
unique features of the repository and the index built for it and seems thus to
be more efficient than general purpose algorithms. Admittedly, this has not
been verified empirically and thus may be reasonably rejected as not relevant.
However, the purpose of this presentation is not to compare algorithms and
their efficiency when applied to the material here, but rather to collect some
low-hanging fruit that became available due to the way the full-text index is
constructed.

Identification of Citations

Index

Since a complete index has already been built for the full-text search, all
experiments make use of this index (Mandoku 2016). The index is constructed
by moving an n-gram window over the text and saving entries at appropriate
locations. The resulting raw index is then read by a grep-like program to
generate the display. The search display is designed to show the keyword in
context (KWIC) so some characters are needed in front of the match character;
these are appended after a comma character in the index entry. We built the
index with a window between 10 and 25, since larger indexes considerable
increase the required space and smaller builds will have too little information
in the KWIC display. The index also contains information to identify the text,
the location of the index excerpt and some information about the context of the
match. Figure 1 shows a typical example of such an index for a 21-gram window.

Algorithm

To find citations in the indexed files, a window of the same size as the index
window is moved over the text passage under investigation. A search is
initiated for a string of n characters, starting at the first index position.
In the example in Figure 1 this would be starting at position 6, since there
are 5 characters after the ","; these characters are preceding the
indexed characters in the text and have therefore been moved to the back. A
query expansion is used for this search, in order to catch character variants
in this initial selection of index lines. A large value of n will increase the
probability that citations are not found due to slight positional variations in
the text, while a small value of n, such as 1, will select many lines that are
not relevant and will thus increase the processing times. Experiments have
shown that a value of 2 or 3 for n gives a good optimum for precision and
recall. Positional values are also registered to better demarcate the citation
boundaries.

The selected lines have to be post-processed to restore the original sequence
as found in the text. The line will then be compared to the window of the
text passage, with scores given for each match; high scores are taken to be a
citation and are marked for further processing. The best results so far have
been achieved for a cumulated score of n-gram matches for values of n from 1 to
3, but additional experiments are planned. Conclusive results will be reported
in the poster presentation.

Additional expected results

With the method introduced here, it becomes feasible to investigate potential
citations for whole texts. We plan to build a heat-map of a text with passages
that have been cited coloured according to their frequency. This will enable
new ways of exploring the intertextuality of texts and will provide new
evidence for the history of ideas and flow of intellectual debt in the history
of Chinese thought. For the presentation of the poster, we show a
preliminary investigation of some key texts of Chinese philosophy as a proof of
concept.

We also hope to identify a set of key phrases and look at their usages over
time, and in different schools of thought, to see what kind of trends can be
seen there.
