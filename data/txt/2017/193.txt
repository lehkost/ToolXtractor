entire scanned data weighs more than 20TB, which makes most usual analysis
techniques out of reach for regular desktop computers. This corpus has been
the focus of several studies analyzing textual data (such as linguistic changes
(Buntix et al, 2016) and named entity recognition (Ehrmann et al, 2016) ). An
example of different layouts of GDL's first page is given in Figure 1 which
shows the evolution of various features, such as title size and position, fonts
and number of columns.

Bitmap Factorial Analysis

In order to analyze layout evolution, we propose to build a static layout
representation for every year in the corpus. Thus, when studying each
newspaper's first page, we define the pixel t of the static representation P[ym
] of month m of year y as

^*+,

The study of newspaper layout evolution through historical corpora has been
addressed by diverse qualitative and quantitative methods in the past few years
(Antonacopoulos et al, 2013; Gonzalez et al, 2001; Liu et al, 2001; Mitchell
and Hong, 2004; Singh and Bhupendra, 2014). The recent availability of
large corpora of newspapers is now making the quantitative analysis of layout
evolution ever more popular. This research investigates a method for the
automatic detection of layout evolution on scanned images with a factorial
analysis approach. The notion of eigenpag-es is defined by analogy with
eigenfaces used in face recognition processes. The corpus of scanned newspapers
that was used contains 4 million press articles, covering about 200 years of
archives. This method can automatically detect layout changes of a
given newspaper over time, rebuilding a part of its past publishing strategy
and retracing major changes in its history in terms of layout. Besides these
advantages, it also makes it possible to compare several newspapers at the same
time and therefore to compare the layout changes of multiple newspapers based
only on scans of their issues.

Introduction to the Corpus

The corpus consists of digitized facsimiles of two

Swiss newspapers, “Journal de Geneve” (JDG) from years 1826 to 1997 and
“Gazette de Lausanne” (GDL) from years 1804 to 1997. Scanned daily issues of
each journal were transcribed using an optical character recognition (OCR)
system (Rochat et al, 2016). The

Where N[ym] is the number of issues in month m of year y and P[y],[m],) is the
first page of day d of month m of year y. The pixel t of the static
representation i" of year y is then defined as

These representations give a vision of the mean layout over the course of a
given year. Each yearly representation can be projected in a
two-dimensional space by performing a principal component analysis (PCA) which
maximizes the covariance on every pixel. This method is analogous to the
eigenfaces method used for face recognition (Turk and Pentland, 1991a, 1991b)
We compute the eigenvectors, that we named eigenpages, as well as the
eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the pixels. The yearly
representations are then projected in the two-dimensional space of the two
eigenvectors which have the highest eigenvalues. The resulting projections of
yearly mean images of JDG and GDL from years 1900 to 1998 are portrayed in
Figure 3. In these figures, each point is a yearly image and consecutive years
are linked in order to highlight the change over time. The further apart the
points are, the bigger the layout's changes occurring between two years. Visual
inspection reveals several clusters of years with a similar
layout. Furthermore, homogeneous sequences of years may be clustered
automatically based on the (unprojected) distance between them (e.g. by
computing the distance between year y and y+1 and “cutting” the sequence of
years at positions where their distance exceeds an arbitrary threshold.

Discussion

The PCA technique allows us to quantify layout changes by covariance analysis
of the pixels of yearly representations. The proportion of covariance
information shown by the PCA is 73% for JDG and 76% for GDL. Visual
interpretation reveals different chronological clusters which are displayed in
Tables 1 and 2 along with their mean positions in the twodimensional space of
eigenpages as well as mean images representing these periods (computed in
the same way as yearly images, cf. Figure 2). These mean images reveal the
major layout transitions in each journal which may be summarized as follows:

Journal de Geneve (JDG):

•    1900-1915: 6 columns, title above columns 2 to 5, little space between
columns.

•    1916-1931: 4 columns, title above columns

1    to 4, more space between columns.

•    1932-1964: 4 columns, change of the layout around the title and the first
title position.

•    1965-1968: 4 columns, change of the layout around the title, boxes with
black borders begin to appear.

•    1969-1991: 4 columns, total change of the title, title above columns 2 to
4, logo appears, more space between columns and

boxes, article titles are bigger.

•    1992-1995: 5 columns, fusion of JDG and GDL, big change of layout, boxes
inside boxes begin to appear, more stable structure.

•    1996-1998: 6 columns, big change in title

font, previous column layout replaced by a more classic one, article titles are
placed at

the top of the first page.

Gazette de Lausanne (GDL):

•    1900-1945: 6 columns, title above columns

2    to 5, little space between columns.

•    1946-1966: 7 columns, title above columns

2 to 6, more space between columns yielding particularly small column sizes.

•    1967-1970: 5 columns, title above columns 2 to 5, first column begins
before the title which is on the right, advertisements placed below the page.

•    1971-1973: 6 columns, more classic layout with article titles at the top.

•    1974-1991: 4 columns, lots of space between columns and articles, bigger
article

titles.

•    1992-1995: 5 columns, fusion of JDG and GDL, big change of layout, boxes
inside boxes begin to appear, more stable structure.

•    1996-1998: 6 columns, big change in title

font, column layout replaced by a more classic one, the article titles are
placed at the

top of the first page.

The automatic clustering method described in previous chapter has been applied
on unprojected distances and produce similar clustering results (depending on
the threshold parameter). Qualitative analysis confirms that the resulting
clusters are all separated by important layout transition phases.

This analysis is also useful to compare several newspaper publishing
strategies. We projected the two newspapers in the same two-dimensional
space representation (presented in Figure 3) using the same method with yearly
representations of both journals in order to compare their chronological
trajectories. The covariance information shown by the PCA is 67%. Visual
inspection reveals three main clusters for each journal. Each of these clusters
turns out to correspond to groups of clusters that has been detected in the
previous projections. We observe that the layout of both journals has evolved
in a similar way but with different timescales. GDL is more dispersed than JDG
and has explored different strategies during the period 1900-1966. However, GDL
has adopted a style more similar to JDG style between 1967 and 1973 just before
it entered a major layout transition in 1974 (5 years later than JDG).

Conclusion

These first results demonstrate a promising method of detecting layout
evolution automatically. The method is applicable to a large variety of
longitudinal image corpora without any prerequisites, since it only requires
images in bitmap format. It make it possible to compare several corpora and
determine periods of layout transitions in a common two-dimensional space for
visual interpretation. In addition, unprojected distances can be used to
determine layout changes in an entirely automatic fashion, by analyzing the
representation space through clustering algorithms. Future work on this method
should include the integration of an alignment method in the
bitmap preprocessing step, because alignment errors may impact the pixel
covariance analysis and eigenpages creation.
