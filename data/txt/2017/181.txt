In this talk, we wish to discuss the construction

of the corpus “Meiji-Taisho Series I - Magazines,” (hereinafter called
CHJ-Magazines) which was released as a part of the Corpus of Historical
Japanese (CHJ). This corpus contains magazines published in Japan in the Meiji
and Taisho periods (1868-1911) representative of Modern Japanese language, with
the total number of words used in the text reaching a size of some 14,000,000
items. This corpus is the first large-scale corpus with morphological
information of Modern Japanese and will contribute to research into that period
of the Japanese language.

At the National Institute for Japanese Language and Linguistics, a joint
research project entitled “Construction of a Diachronic Corpus and
New Developments in Research of the Japanese Language” was begun in 2016. CHJ
Magazines is one part of this project, using a number of representative
magazines for each of several periods, with the selected published material
spread out over set time intervals. The result is a large-scale corpus that
makes it possible to examine the state of the written Japanese language in the
Meiji and Taisho periods, as well as to examine how the language underwent
changes in those periods

Table 1. Corpus Size for Each Year of Publication (Units:

Thousand Words)

One characteristic of this corpus is that morphological (word) information is
annotated to each text. In order to annotate highly accurate morphological
information to the corpus, it was necessary to develop and utilize a dictionary
that could enable automatic morphological analysis for the colloquial and
literary styles that was mixed in the

written Japanese of the aforementioned periods. We

customized UniDic, a dictionary for morphological analysis of Japanese, which
can lemmatize variations of orthography and word forms. We also used MeCab, a
state-of-the-art Japanese morphological analyzer with this customized UniDic.

While the accuracy of automatic analysis is high at approximately 93%, it is
extremely difficult to append morphological information uniformly without
any mistakes in such a large amount of text. To address this difficulty, it was
necessary to establish a “core” data set, for which we could guarantee the
attachment of highly accurate morphological information (with accuracy higher
than 99%) through the utilization of automatic computer analysis together with
manual (human) correction. For core data, 500,000 words were selected, taking
into consideration the balance of publication year, style and genre of each of
the articles sampled. Core data is suitable for Japanese research which
requires highly accurate morphological information. This data was also used as
training data for the dictionary for morphological analysis described above.
The automatic analysis results of the “non-core” data set, meanwhile, received
a certain degree of manual correction which, while not being exhaustive,
strikes a balance between quality and volume.

This corpus is made publicly accessible by way of an online search application
called "Chünagon.” With "Chünagon,” it is possible to carry out searches
that specify complex combinations of different morphological information
(lemma, part-of-speech,

conjugation type, lexical strata, etc.). The search results also display
information on the source (magazine title, article title, year of publishing),
author (name, sex, year of birth), data type (core, non-core), text type
(conversation, quotation, other), text style (literary, colloquial, mixture,
verse), etc. The author information includes a link to catalogues in
the National Diet Library. By making use of this convenient service, it is
possible to check how to read the name of the author of the article in
question, to check when he or she was born and died, and, at the

same time, to see if he or she made use of multiple

other names. The “Chunagon” search results also provide links that allow the
viewing of images of corresponding pages in the original magazines.
