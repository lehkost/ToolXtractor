Introduction

Enjambment takes place when a syntactic unit is broken up across two lines of
poetry (Domínguez Ca-parrós, 2000: 103), giving rise to different stylistic
effects (e.g. increased emphasis on elements of the broken-up phrase, or
contrast between those elements), or creating double interpretations for the
enjambed lines (García-Paje, 1991).

In Spanish poetry, the syntactic configurations under which enjambment takes
place have been described extensively, and detailed studies on the use of
enjambment by individual authors exist (see Martínez Cantón, 2011 for an
overview) including, among others Quilis (1964), Domínguez Caparrós, (2000),
Paraíso, (2000), Spang (1983) for a description of enjambment,

and Alarcos (1966), Senabre (1982), Luján (2006), Martínez Fernández (2010) for
case-studies on a single author. However, a larger-scale study to identify
enjamb-ment across hundreds of authors spanning several centuries, enabling
distant reading (Moretti, 2013), was not previously available.

Given that need, we have developed software, based on Natural Language
Processing, that automatically identifies enjambment in Spanish, and applied
it to a corpus of approx. 3750 sonnets by ca. 1000 authors, from the 15th to
the 19th century. What is the interest of such large-scale automatic analyses
of en-jambment? First, the literature shows a debate about which specific
syntactic units can be considered to trigger enjambment, if split across two
lines, and whether lexical and syntactic criteria are sufficient to identify
enjambment. Second, the stylistic effects that enjambment permits are also an
object of current research (Martínez Fernández, 2010).
Systematically collecting large amounts of enjambment examples provides helpful
evidence to assess scholars' current claims, and may stimulate novel analyses.
Finally, our study complements Navarro's (2016) automatic metrical analyses of
Spanish Golden Age sonnets, by covering a wider period and focusing on
enjambment.

The abstract is structured thus: First we provide the definition of enjambment
adopted. Then, our corpus and system are described, followed by an evaluation
of the system. Finally, findings on enjambment in our diachronic sonnet corpus
are discussed. The project's website provides details omitted here for
space reasons, including samples for the corpus, results, and other details.

Enjambment in Spanish

Syntactic and metrical units often match in poetry. However, this trend has
been broken since antiquity for various reasons (Parry (1929) on Homer, or
Flores Gómez (1988) on early classical poetry).

In Spanish tradition, enjambment (in Spanish, “encabalgamiento”) is considered
to take place when a pause suggested by poetic form (e.g. at the end of a
line or across hemistichs) occurs between strongly connected lexical or
syntactic units, triggering an unnatural cut between those units.

Quilis (1964) performed poetry reading experiments, proposing that the
following strongly connected elements give rise to enjambment, should a
poetic-form pause break them up:

•    Lexical enjambment: Breaking up a word.

We translated “lexical enjambment” from Quilis's terms “encabalgamiento léxico”
or “tmesis”.

•    Phrase-bounded enjambment: Within a phrase, breaking up sequences like
“noun + adjective”, “verb + adverb”, “auxiliary verb + main verb”, among
others. We translated

“phrase-bounded enjambment” from    “en

cabalgamiento sirremático”.

•    Cross-clause enjambment: Between a noun antecedent and the pronoun
heading the relative clause that complements the antecedent. We translated
“cross-clause en-jambment” from Quilis's “encabalgamiento oracional”.

The project site includes Quilis's complete list of syntactic environments that
can trigger enjambment, as well as the types identified by our system.
Besides the enjambment types above, Spang (1983) noted that if a subject or
direct object and their related verbs occur in two different lines of poetry,
this can also feel unusual for a reader, even if the effect is less pronounced
than in the environments identified by Quilis. To differentiate these cases
from enjambment proper, Spang calls these cases “enlace”, translated here as
“expansion”.

Quilis (1964) was the only author so far to gather recitation-based
experimental evidence on enjamb-ment. His typology is still considered current,
and was adopted by later authors, although complementary en-jambment typologies
have been proposed, as Martínez Cantón (2011) reviews. Our system identifies
Quilis' types, besides Spang's expansion cases.

Corpus

The corpus is based on two public online collections from Biblioteca Virtual
Cervantes (García González, R. (ed.), 2006a, 2006b). The first one covers 1088
sonnets by 477 authors from the 15th-17th centuries. The second one contains
2673 sonnets by 685 authors from the 19th century. We created scripts to
download the poems, remove HTML and extract dates of birth and death for the
authors (About 30% of the 15th to 17th century authors had exact dates of birth
and death, for the rest only the centuries were available. Among the 19th
century authors, ca. 45% had exact dates of birth and death). Table 1 shows the
distribution of authors and poems by century. The corpus covers canonical
as well as minor authors, inspired in distant reading approaches (Moretti,
2007, 2013).

The system has three components: a preprocessing module to format input poems
uniformly, an NLP pipeline, and the enjambment-detection module itself.

The NLP pipeline is IXA Pipes (Agerri et al., 2014). Its results for
contemporary Spanish are competitive. Our system uses it to obtain
part-of-speech tags, syntactic constituency (e.g. verb-phrase, noun-phrase) and
syntactic dependencies (e.g. direct object).

The enjambment detection module is rule and dictionary-based, and exploits the
information provided by the NLP pipeline. Rules (30 in total) of
different characteristics identify enjambed lines, assigning

them a type among a list of 12 types, based on the typology in Section 2 (the 
full list of types identified by the system is available on the project site).

•    Some rules are very shallow and only take parts of speech into account.

•    Some rules additionally exploit constituency info.

•    Some rules use dependency information, e.g. to detect “subject / object /
verb” relations.

•    For any type of rule, custom dictionaries can restrict rule application to
a set of terms.

E.g. certain verbs govern arguments introduced by one specific preposition; we
itemized these verbs and their prepositions in a dictionary, to complement
information provided by the NLP pipeline or correct parsing errors.

Enjambment annotations are output in standoff format. Further details can be
found on the project's site.

System description


System evaluation and discussion

Test-corpus

To evaluate the system, we created two reference-sets (SonnetEvol and
Cantos20th), manually annotating enjambment in them.

1. SonnetEvol: 100 sonnets (1400 lines) from our diachronic sonnet corpus of
ca. 3750 sonnets (Table Table). This test-set contains 260 pairs of enjambed
lines (in other words, if there is an enjambment between lines 1 and 2, we
consider that as “pair of enjambed lines” in the reference corpus).

2. Cantos20th: 1000 lines of 20^th century poetry (Colinas, 1983), showing
natural contemporary syntax. We identified 277 pairs of enjambed lines.

The distribution of enjambment types in the test-corpora is balanced (Table 2).
The SonnetEvol diachronic test-corpus is balanced across periods (Table 3). It
should be noted that balancing across periods does not apply to the Cantos20th
test-corpus: it covers the 20^th century only.

We annotated the Cantos20th corpus in order to assess the system's performance
on contemporary Spanish with natural diction, compared to its behaviour with
the SonnetEvol corpus, which includes some archaic constructions and often
shows an elevated register.

For the evaluation reported here, each sonnet was annotated by a single
annotator. Obtaining multiple annotators' input on the same sonnet to assess
interannotator agreement (Artstein and Poesio, 2008) is part of our ongoing
work.

Enjambment-detection tasks evaluated We defined two enjambment-detection tasks:

•    Span-match: the positions of enjambed lines proposed by the system must
match the positions in the reference corpus for a correct result to be counted.

•    Typed span-match: for a correct result, both the positions and the
enjambment type assigned by the system to those positions must match the
reference.

System results and discussion

Precision, recall and F1 were obtained. The definitions for Precision (P),
Recall (R) and F1 were the usual:

P R    nbr. of correct outputs    nbr. of correct outputs

p-j — 2_ • p — _~    . p —_2_

P + R ’ nbr. of system outputs ’ nbr. of reference outputs

Table 4 provides overall results for both corpora. Table 5 provides the
per-type results on the diachronic test-corpus (SonnetEvol). The project's site

contains more detailed results (e.g. per-type results for the Cantos20th
corpus, or breakdowns for Sonnet-Evol per period).

t-types

For untyped detection (span-match), F1 reaches 80% in the SonnetEvol corpus,
whereas F1 for typed detection is 66.31%. For the contemporary Spanish corpus
(Cantos20th), F1 is higher: 80.63% typed detection, 86.51% span-match. This
reflects additional difficulties posed by archaic language and
historical varieties for the NLP system whose outputs our en-jambment detection
relies on. Expansions get lower F1 than phrase-bounded types overall. But we do
not think that the F1 difference between SonnetEvol and Cantos20th is due to
the higher proportion of expansions in SonnetEvol (Table 2): Results per-type
(see the evaluation page of the project’s site) show that phrase-bounded
enjambment detection is 10 points of F1 lower in SonnetEvol than in Cantos20th.
Also, phrase-bounded enjambment results for the 15^th-17^th period (with more
archaic language) are 10 points of F1 lower than in the 19^th century.

A common source of error was hyperbaton: the displacement of phrases triggers
constituency and dependency parsing errors. Prepositional phrase (PP)
attachment also posed challenges: Verbal adjuncts get mistaken for PPs
complementing nouns or adjectives. This is a common problem in syntactic
parsing, even for contemporary languages (see Agirre et al, 2008, for English).
For historical varieties, Stein’s (2016) results for verbal adjuncts and
prepositional complements in Old French also suggest the difficulties posed by
prepositional phrases.

Creating a reparsing module to manage hyperbaton and improve PP attachment
results may be fruitful future work.

Scholarly results and discussion

The system’s goal is detecting enjambment to help literary research on the
phenomenon, via providing systematic evidence for its analysis.

We consider our untyped enjambed-line detection results helpful, given an F1 of
ca. 80% on the diachronic test-set. As an example application, we examined the
distribution of enjambment according to position in the poem, particularly in
positions across a verse-boundary (lines 4-5, 8-9 and 11-12). Comparing the
results for the 15^th-to-17^th centuries vs. the 19^th century (Table 6 and
Figure 1), we see that enjamb-ment across the tercets increases clearly in the
19^th century, with a small increase of enjambment across the quatrains (lines
4-5) and across the octave-sestet divide (lines 8-9). Given the manageable data
volume, we validated the counts for enjambment across a verse boundary (Table
6) manually (but not the more voluminous data for all other positions).

The value of the tool is helping perform such analyses on a large corpus. This
opens the door for scholars to assess the literary relevance of the findings,
and search for the best interpretation.

Figure 1: Percentage of enjambments per position in the 15^th-17^th centuries
vs. the 19^th.

The y-axis represents line-positions; the x-axis is the percentage of enjambed
line-pairs for a position over all enjambed line-pairs in the period.
Enjambment across quatrains and across the octave-sestet divide is very
rare, with a small increase in the 19^th century. The division between the
tercets blurs in the 19^th century, in the sense that enjambment across them is
clearly higher than in the previous period

Outlook

The characterization of enjambment in Spanish literary theory has unclear
points. Systematically obtaining enjambment examples is helping us find
additional evidence to analyze these unclear points. Moreover, we are not aware
of a systematic large-sample study of enjambment across periods, literary
movements, or versification types in Spanish, or other languages. Automatic
detection can help answer interesting questions in verse theory, which would
benefit from a quantitative approach, complementing small-sample analyses.
e.g.: To what an extent is enjambment used differently in free verse vs.
traditional versification?

Students in our metrics classes are currently annotating enjambment for 450
sonnets. These annotations will permit inter-annotator agreement
computation. We will also examine the possibility of using supervised machine
learning to train a sequence labeling and classification model to complement
our current detection rules.
