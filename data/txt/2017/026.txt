Our project involves developing a new kind of digital resource to capture the
history of research at scientific facilities in the era of the “New Big
Science.” The extent, scope, and diversity of research at such facilities makes
keeping track of it difficult to compile using traditional historical methods
and linear narratives; there are too many overlapping and bifurcating threads.
In this talk, we will discuss existing methods of data collection and curation
for a specific case project, the National Synchrotron Light Source Digital
Archive. We are especially interested in the functional potential, in the
context of this kind of tool development, of the humanistic concepts of
narrative, metaphor, and performance.
